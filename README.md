***
This small application takes a timelog file as created by the
[Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) `M-x timeclock-in` and
`M-x timeclock-out` commands, and provides the following summary information:
- The number of days worked; the number of unique dates that have a clock in (`i`) event.
- The total number of hours and minutes clocked.
- The average number of hours and minutes clocked per day.
- The cummulative overtime up to but not including the last date there was a clock in, typically yesterday.
- The first clock in of today.
- The number of hours worked today.
- The number of hours and minutes still to work today, taking overtime into account.
- The number of hours and minutes still to work today, based on an 8 hour workday today.
- The time to leave, taking overtime into account.
- The time to leave, based on an 8 hour workday today.
